## Create Your Own

1. Create a fork of this repo.
2. Add the exported YML with variables where needed such as email address, username, etc. See examples. Ensure your template is either filled out with correct key variables so the CLI can automatically fill in automatically, or provide enough documentation for others to be able to properly import and use your template. 
3. Supply an appropriate description like what does the template hope to accomplish, what are the possible use cases, etc. 
4. Add folder path to `index.js` so others can make use of your template from within the CLI.
5. Submit PR and await review/merge!
